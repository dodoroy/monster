    <h1>Editable SVG Icon System</h1>
    <blockquote>
      There are many ways to create an SVG Icon System, but one method that takes advantage of Vueâ€™s capabilities is to
      create editable inline icons as components. Some of the advantages of this way of working is:
      <ul>
        <li>They are easy to edit on the fly</li>
        <li>They are animatable</li>
        <li>You can use standard props and defaults to keep them to a typical size or alter them if you need to</li>
        <li>They are inline, so no HTTP requests are necessary</li>
        <li>They can be made accessible dynamically</li>
      </ul>
